Please pay attention to the important message from Julien regarding the project and the framework. Read and understand the framework thoroughly: [ALX SE Framework](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559)

## Important Notes

- **Copying Code:** Avoid copying code from other sources, including other students or online articles/videos. Original work is essential.
- **Using AI Tools:** While ChatGPT and similar tools are encouraged in the framework, they should be used responsibly. Do not use them to code the solution directly.

## Collaboration and Pair Programming

This is a group project, and collaboration is crucial. Work together with your partner (Miracle Hycient) and ensure both team members understand every line of code. Read about pair programming [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/121).

If there are challenges or if you can't contribute at any point, communicate with both the staff and your partner promptly.

## Plagiarism Warning

Plagiarism is not tolerated. Both team members are responsible for the code pushed to Github. If caught for plagiarism, both partners will face consequences.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Read the provided framework thoroughly.
3. Understand the project requirements and start coding your own shell.

Have fun working on the Simple Shell project! Good luck!
